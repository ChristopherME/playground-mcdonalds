## Package Structure and Software Design Patterns

Monolithic app that uses feature layer package structure approach. It has each layer package isolated one from the other one, so it makes it highly [modularizable](https://medium.com/proandroiddev/the-abc-of-modularization-for-android-in-2021-e7b3fbe29fca) if necessary.

It uses [MVVM](https://medium.com/proandroiddev/understanding-mvvm-pattern-for-android-in-2021-98b155b37b54) as software design patter at presentation layer level.

In the upper layers such as Domain & Data, it uses the Repository pattern for abstract and obtain the data from the API service.

For provide dependencies it uses "manual" Dependency Injection as it is a small project that does not require any extra library for provide deps. (The same choice why this wasn't modularized at first glance).

## Tech Stack
- Application entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
- Asynchronous processing using [Coroutines](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/)
- HttpClient [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
- State stream management using [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow)
- Jetpack [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
- Uses [JUnit4](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-rules) for unit testing
- Uses [Turbine](https://github.com/cashapp/turbine) for testing flows
- Uses [Mockk](https://mockk.io) for mock behaviour while unit testing
